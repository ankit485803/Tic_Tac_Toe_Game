Hey there, fellow coder! 👋 Welcome to the repository of my latest coding escapade – the Tic Tac Toe Game! 🚀

# Project Overview
In the midst of my IIT Patna classes and academic pursuits, I embarked on a two-week coding adventure to bring this classic game to life. Built entirely with the trio of web development magic - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project is more than just a grid of Xs and Os; it's a testament to creativity and coding finesse.

# Features at a Glance 🌟
(a) Dual Player Mode: Challenge a friend with the timeless choice between 'zero' and 'cross'.
(b) Victory Conditions: Triumph by aligning three symbols either diagonally, column-wise, or row-wise. 🏆
(c) Seamless Transitions: Enjoy the continuous gaming experience as the game smoothly transitions to a replay option upon completion.
(d) Web Development Magic: The entire game is based on the trio of web development technologies – HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the interactive magic.

# Tech Stack: 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript 🌐
